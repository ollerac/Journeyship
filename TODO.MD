### what i *need* before launching:
- version control
- add one or more layer to objects
- add objects to main color palette
- delete objects from main board
- delete objects from main color palette


### would be *really* nice to have:
- use version control
- be able to check a box to see that last layer that you're painting over for an object
- speech bubbles


### would be nice to have:
- add arbitrary colors to the main color palette and the object color palette
- interaction rules
- custom animation interval
