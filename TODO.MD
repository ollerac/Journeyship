### what i *need* before launching:

- be able to check a box to see that last layer that you're painting over for an object
- delete objects from main board
- delete objects from main color palette
- data persistence


### would be *really* nice to have:
- a transparent color
- add journeyship logo (with sail moving)

### would be nice to have:
- add arbitrary colors to the main color palette and the object color palette
- interaction rules
- custom animation interval





### recently finishished:
